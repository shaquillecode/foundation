#Class 1: 
'''
What is the diff between a compiler and an interpreter

(Might give you a screenshot of code and say something like "What's happening on any specific line of code from that image.)

GOod Programming Practices

What is programming?

'''

#Day 2
'''

What is Data? -> Binary, Remember how to count in Binary and Add and Stuff... and bits and bytes and stuff..

Variables!!!! -> best naming practices... Rules, (just know what you cannot do, so that you dont do it ever.)

Data Types!!!!

Assigning Values to a Variable!!

'''

#Day 3
'''

Know all the different types of String Formatting. (Recognize them, and write them)

'''

#Day 4:
'''

Understand the Python Collection Data Types: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, (Strings)

CRUD Operations : (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate (D)elete, on different COllection Data Types. 

Immutable vs Mutable

Indexing

'''

#Day 5:
'''

This is kind of an extension of Day 4, but instead of Lists, you're also working with Dictionaries, and Tuples.

CRUD Operations on Lists, Dictionaries, Strings, and Tuples...

KNOW WHAT DATA TYPE YOU ARE WORKING WITH AT ALLLLLLL TIMES

'''
#Day 6: Functions
'''

What is a function?
Defining a function
PARAMETERS AND ARGUMENTS
Passing arguments to functions
(Number of parameters and arguments): Understand if you wrote your function with 2 paramters, you MUST be passed 2 arguments....

Example of what can go wrong.....
def add(x, y):
    return x+y

add(9, 6, 8) 


RETURN VALUES <------ IMPORTANT!!!! (Make sure that you are ALWAYS checking what Data Type is coming in, and expected to go out!)(Then CHECK your data for its type to make sure that it is correct...)

(Back to Data Types, this is where we started talking about Booleans)

Comparison and Logical Operators!! 
***Please note that equality is done like this: "==" not like this "="

Truth Logical Table 

Conditionals and Chained Conditionals
If/Elif/Else and Nested (Just in case, probably not gonna happen but JUST IN CASE...)

'''

#Day 7:
'''

Go Over the PythonNotes6 Resource on Populi

#Comparison Operators 
#Examples of Comparison Operators are:
#(>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) -> These are used to compare values 


'''

#Day 8: Loops
'''

know the different types of loops

UNDERSTAND that when I say GIVEN any SEQUENCE of data and I ask you do do something with the sequence that involves more than just ONE item of that sequence.... LOOOOOOOOP!!!!! 

When to use Counters!! -> When we are calculating for sum
What even are Counters!? -> Counters are variables that is incremented or decremented each time a loop repeats. (For more refer to slide 19 of Class 8))

'''

#Class 9: 
'''

Understand the Modulus Operator

Identifying Different Data Types by Syntax

Range method and how arguments affect it. (Read the part on range function and just know that it can take either 1, 2, or 3 parameters, and each has its own meaning... Learn that meaning by reading pythonNotes7)

'''

#Day 10: 
'''

Modules in Python : Think Random and Statistic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

'''

#Day 12: Files
'''

Remember that the method to open files in python is literally: open()

Remember the different open modes, specifically: 
#What is the code for read? -> "r"
#What is the code for write? -> "w"
#What is the code for append? -> "a"

The most you'll get is ONE question. And it'll look like this: 

What is this file doing?
file = open("sampleFile.txt", "r")
#I am opening a file called sampleFile and I can WRITE TO IT
